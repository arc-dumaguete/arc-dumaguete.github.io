# Arc Dumaguete site

The site is made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/), which allows us to author the site using Markdown syntax, which gets compiled into HTML.

## Setting up the repositories locally

You should clone the repository and check out the jekyll branch with:
```
git clone git@github.com:arc-dumaguete/arc-dumaguete.github.io.git
git checkout jekyll
```
The jekyll branch jis the default branch and is where you should edit/add your posts. From there, the compiled HTML for the website is automatically generated by Travis-CI as soon as you commit and push. So no need to do that manually. You can even add/edit pages directly on github.com.

*The steps below are no longer needed*

We have it setup so that the master branch contains the compiled html version, while the jekyll branch contains the jekyll source.
Then you can author in the jekyll branch, compile, and push the resulting site to the master branch. The easiest way to get this to work is to `git clone git@github.com:arc-dumaguete/arc-dumaguete.github.io.git` clone the repository, then `git checkout jekyll`. Then again, but now in side the existing clone of the jekyll branch, `git clone git@github.com:arc-dumaguete/arc-dumaguete.github.io.git ./_site`. This will clone the master branch in the `_site` directory. This directory is where jekyll will put the compiled HTML version, and that folder is ignored in `.gitignore` so won't be included in the jekyll branch. 

## Installing dependencies
You only need to do this if you want to locally serve the site for testing, or if you want to manually build the site. If you just want to add/edit a post, just make/edit the file in the jekyll branch and commit and push. Travis-CI takes care of the rest.

Make sure you have ruby, ruby-dev (or ruby-devel in redhat/centos/fedora) and rubygem-bundler installed.
Install npm/nodejs and gulp, probably easiest through the package manager or your OS.
Run
```
bundler install
npm install
```

## Editing
Edit the files in _posts or add new files there. Make sure to look at an existing file and check the Front Matter, including the author.
New authors should be added to _authors.yml

Afterwards, don't forget to commit and push your changes.

## Building/compiling the site
There is no need to manually compile and push the website. The process is automated using travis-ci. So as soon as you commit and push to the jekyll branch, travis-ci will take care of building the site and pushing to the master branch.

If you still want to manually build the site, this is how to do it:
Run
```
bundler exec jekyll build
```
then to publish
```
cd _site
git add *
git commit -a
git push
```

## Serving locally for testing
```
bundler exec jekyll serve
```

## Hiding and showing pages
If you want to hide a page, you can set `published: False` in the front matter for that page. That way it will not show up on the site. If you still want to see that page locally for testing purposes, you can start your local version with `bundler exec jekyll serve --unpublished`

## Compiling styles
The styles are in assets/css. If you modify them, you need to compile them with `gulp`.
