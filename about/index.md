Dumaguete's ARC is a non-profit organisation in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, The Philippines. Our aim is to stimulate a professional and innovative economy in Dumaguete by providing guidance, facilities, and most importantly, a community to people who are not satisfied by simply walking the well trodden path. We have people with all kinds of expertise, ranging from software developers and IoT engineers to entrepreneurs, consultants and people that made their career in the financial sector. No matter your nationality, background or age, if you are located in our area and are willing to learn, go the extra mile, and are professional, we welcome you.
